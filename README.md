## Chessfactory: hall of fame
![](etc/img/cf.png)

The purpose of this project is to explore the [lichess database](https://database.lichess.org/) for interesting games and positions. As an example, I created my list of interesting parties by various criteria (see below).

Originally, [Chessfactory](https://github.com/mark-dev/chessfactory) is my study web chess project, inspired by [lichess](https://lichess.org).

This project has same name prefix, because also study and inspired by lichess :)

Used tools:

* [lichess database](https://database.lichess.org/) 
* My fork of [chesspresso java lib](https://github.com/mark-dev/chesspresso)
* [Spring](https://spring.io/) with [Spring integration](https://spring.io/projects/spring-integration)
* [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.yandex/)

  
I scan lichess database(there was 602M games at march 2019) and here is my results:

1. [List games where defeated side has piece advantage](etc/docs/results/got-mate-with-extra-material.md)
